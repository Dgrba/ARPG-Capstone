# ARPG-Capstone
This project is an ARPG video game created by my team in Godot for a Computer Science Capstone final project. 

My contributions to the game involved designing, bulding, and displaying the Player Skill Tree UI which presented the player with available skills that would change their player stats and abilities. 

**My contributed files**: skill_button.gd, skilltree.tscn

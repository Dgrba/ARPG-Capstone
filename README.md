# ARPG-Capstone
This project is an ARPG video game created by my team in Godot for a Computer Science Capstone final project. 
The project required creating the game while utilizing AGILE development methods which involved: 
- assigning developer roles
- breaking up development into weekly sprints
- sheduling meetings to discuss progress and development changes
- cataloging develpoment progress

My contributions to the game involved designing, building, and displaying the Player Skill Tree UI which presented the player with available skills that would change their player stats and abilities. 

My contributed files: **skill_button.gd**, **skilltree.tscn**
